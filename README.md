## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Program Instructions

The program will greet the user and ask which conversion feature the user would like to use. 
Enter A to convert from kgs to lbs
Enter B to convert from grams to ounces
Enter C to convert from km to miles
Enter D to convert from mm to inches 
Or enter exit to exit the program

Once ther user has recieved you converted number, the program will ask whether the user would like to make another conversion.
Enter yes or y to continue
Enter n or no to exit the program

Only numeric enteries are permitted where the user input is not specified.
